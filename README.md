# AudioController
Controls audio of different processes (Can connect to Serial/Arduino)

**ONLY WINDOWS!!** because pythonscript runs on [`pycaw`](https://github.com/AndreMiras/pycaw)

**Linux is work in Progress**

## Build-Note
* Import latest build of [Java-Project-Library](https://github.com/realPaulsen/Java-Project-Library) into Project before building
* Pyhton-Script needs additional libraries. Just try to run and see what's missingðŸ˜…ðŸ¤¦
