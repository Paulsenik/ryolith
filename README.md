# AudioController
Controls audio of different processes (Can connect to Serial/Arduino)

**ONLY WINDOWS!!** (for now) because pythonscript runs on [`pycaw`](https://github.com/AndreMiras/pycaw)

## Build-Note
* Import latest build of [Java-Project-Library](https://github.com/realPaulsen/Java-Project-Library) into Project before building
* Import external library [jSerialComm](https://github.com/Fazecast/jSerialComm) for serial/USB-Connection
* Windows: Pyhton-Script needs additional libraries. Just try to run and see what's missingðŸ˜…ðŸ¤¦

## **TODO**
* **Linux is work in Progress**
